About mips64emul's regression tests:

Adding a new test should be done by writing an assembly language file called
test_X.S, where X is the next available number, and an corresponding
test_X.good file which contains the wanted output.  Also remember to add a
one-liner about the test to this file!

The code in test_common.c calls a function called testmain() in each test
(which should return an int value) and prints the return value in hex.
If a test wants to check more than one int, then it may call printhex()
and printstr() manually, as long as the output of the program and the contents
of test_X.good are the same.

These are the tests that exist so far:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
test_0		A "dummy" test. Copy this when creating new tests.
test_1		Instruction: 'addu'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regression test related TODOs:

	o)  All instructions.
	o)  32-bit vs 64-bit modes?
	o)  MIPS I, II, III, IV, V (?), MDMX (?)
	o)  MIPS16 encoding?
	o)  32-bit vs 64-bit ELFs?
	o)  Try the regression tests using different compilers automagically?
	    ie gcc vs ccc vs solaris' cc...

Other TODOs:

	o)  Remove the usage of tmpnam(), and make do_tests.c less
	    ugly in general.
